Here are my dotfiles and miscellaneous scripts.

There is a simple install script that links dots/.* to ~/. Any
existing dot files will be clobbered, so be careful. It only manages
symlinks, I install the programs themselves with Ansible.

My .emacs.d isn't included because this repo is cloned on remote
servers as well as my workstation. Check that out
[here](https://github.com/glynnforrest/emacs.d).
